# Boston Concert Calendar

### Project Overview
The Boston Concert Calendar is a web application designed to provide residents and visitors of Boston with a centralized platform to discover upcoming concerts in the area. By leveraging the Ticketmaster API, our application aggregates and displays concert information in an easy-to-use calendar format. While there are various sources for concert information, we aim to create a user-friendly, one-stop solution for music lovers in Boston.
